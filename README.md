# Pawsome Pics

## Introduction

This project is part of the "Using JavaScript in Websites" course from the Frontend Masters Bootcamp. Initially titled "Dog App Exercise," I renamed it to "Pawsome Pics." This interactive web app allows users to select a breed of dog from a dropdown menu and displays an image of the selected breed. The project is a practical representation of working with APIs, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I put extra effort into the design to give it a unique look and feel. The app is mobile-friendly, which I personally added. The biggest lesson from this project was learning API integration, a key skill covered in this lesson. Creating a loading spinner was also a fun and valuable exercise that I will use throughout my career. The heart-shaped spinner is a unique touch that aligns with the modern, family-friendly vibe of the app. Both logos are original, showcasing my ability to implement cohesive and engaging visual elements.
